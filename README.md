### üí≠ Thesis

AI and ML technologies offer nearly limitless upside potential to humankind and we would be foolish not to pursue these endeavours to the absolute fullest.

Here are the industries that I've found to be most compatible with my approach and outlook:
- Telecommunications - There is a real need for AI agents and ML modeling when approaching human-facing spaces and the ubiquity of telecommunications offers a lot of opportunity to enhance existing processes through action-automation and decision-automation.
- Resource Extraction - As humans become more conscious of our impact on the world around us, optimising and improving extractive industries through technology is an imperative endeavour.
- Pure Technology - I am a technologist. Innovation for the sake of innovation will always excite me.

### üíº Experience

I am an architect and engineer with a demonstrated history of solving complex real-world problems creatively. I contribute to a number of open source projects because I believe in the power of the community.

Here are some types of discrete software projects where I have made an impact as an engineer, architect or both; for these projects I have engaged as a community contributer, contracted consultant, full-time employee or simply a garage band team of associates:
  - ETL pipelines to industry-leading platforms like HubSpot, Zendesk, Brevo, AppsFlyer, Braze and Contentful
  - Text-to-text, voice-to-voice, text-to-voice and computer vision AI agents for use cases associated with the interpretation of complex legal documents, customer support, service and experience, accounts payable / receivable, analysis of geological surveying documentation, cartographical resources and tools
  - RPA processes using Microsoft Power Automate, KNIME, and other "no code" solutions as well as containerised and orchestrated code solutions using any of my preferred languages (as well as a few in other languages well!)
  - Encryption and anonymisation of production data or generation of pseudo-realistic data so as to support use in non-production systems
  - Application Programming Interfaces (API) hosted on-site or in the cloud

Here are the languages I prefer to use in order of fluency:
- Python
- C
- C#
- Rust

### üèÜ Goals

Build the best future we can using the best information we've got.
